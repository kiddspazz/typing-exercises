# My personal typing practice files for use with gtypist
I guess I'm going to start collecting sections of text for typing exercises.

To install gtypist:
`brew install gtypist`

NOTES to myself:
- Use the demo.typ to build new files correctly.
- Start the exercise with `gtypist [name-of-file]`
- Type away
